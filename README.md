# Martian-Harmony
## Srishti 2019 
The idea was to build a robot that can play musical instruments in the same fashion as humans. It consists of various instruments like Flute, Keyboard, Guitar, etc. All these instruments are being played using different mechanisms.

## Motivation:
This is a really good combination of robotics and music. There are many people who don't know how to play instruments but appreciate good music. This band could help those people live their dreams.

## Software Information Basics:
* For the mechanical model, designing of the complete setup is done on solidworks and some of the parts are 3D printed using Ultimaker 3D printer.
* We primarily needed to supply all the notes to the respective instruments and also the time at which they needed to be played. Initially we used Image processing to extract the notes using music sheet. The notes extraction was successful but we were not able to locate the time at which a note was to be played/stopped. So we dropped the idea of using a music sheet. 
* Then we used MIDI files which are basically digital music files and have the information of all the notes of different instruments and the time at which a particular note is to be played. To extract all this information from the MIDI file we used the java codes given in notes, ON/OFF and the time files.
* We did this for a few songs as only a good MIDI file was available for these much songs and for other songs either the MIDI was not available or a lot of noise was present in the MIDI file. Through MIDI files proper node times were given to the particular instruments.We have to code the instruments using arduino for those particular nodes.Check individual codes for this purpose.

## Applications:
We can make an automatic music band with more improvisations and additions. It could also be used for teaching puposes. It could even be used for fun purposes.

## Limitations:
* The rack and pinion mechanism used for pressure control in flute wasn't that much accurate and also added some extra noise. We could have used digital pressure controller for blowing air into the flute instead of rack and pinion mechanism. No doubt digital pressure controller would have costed more (around 2.5k inr which is about 10 times the price of rack and pinion controller used) but it would have been much more precise.
* The major difficulty that we faced in piano playing bot was the insufficient power generated by soleniodal motors. We could have used more powerful soleniodal motors for a better bot.

## Future Improvements:
We are planning to use digital pressure controller and more powerful soleniodal motors (or any better substitute) in the upcoming versions. We will be including drum kit playing bot in the next version.
